# The Best Project

This project is a combination of a classical FPS game and derivatives combined.  

## How To Play

We used simple controls, with WASD to move and E to interact. Shoot with the left mouse button to destroy the enemies. To heal, interact with the green cube located in the middle of the map. This will prompt you with an expression. To heal, you need to derive the expression while running away from the enemies. After figuring out the answer is, input it in the input box above the expresion. If the answer is right, you will heal fully, if it's not, you will take some damage.
